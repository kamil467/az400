Choosing repo stragety ?
Monorepo vs multi repo advantages and challenges

| Monorepo | Multi-repo|
| ---- | ---|
| Advantages: easy to share and maintain code, easy for applying tools and policies , single view of discoverability | helps in microservices architecture, team ownership, individual teams own the repos, promote code decoupling |
| Challenges : too complex to maintain when code base large , single code change could affect multiple teams |  applying policies , maintaining standards will be difficult acorss repositories , lack of shared code support |
